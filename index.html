                About me: I have been married for 27 years, have 3 daughters (Tori, Lizzy and Rachael),
                one grandaughter (Lily), and I help care for my great-nephew (Jaxon) from time to time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been playing ice hockey since I was 9 years old and still play today on 2 teams.
                I am originally from Upstate NY and have been in the Metro Denver area for 22 years. We love
                Colorado and love to spend time at our mountain home (hiking, snow shoeing, skiing, biking).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been working in healthcare for over 20 years, the majority of that time in Supply Chain.
                I have held a variety of leadership roles within supply chain: Central Supply Operations, Inventory
                Management,
                Value Analysis, Strategic Sourcing, Contract Management and Supply Chain Informatics.

                Today I am the Director of Supply Chain Informatics. My teams specialize in master data management,
                ERP (Lawson) implemenation, training, and break/fix support, SharePoint Site and workflow development
                with Infopath and Nintex,
                data architecture in SSIS, database management in SSMS, and data visualization mostly PowerBI.
            </p>
            <p>
                My team is called upon to improve processes across supply chain by matching our tools and capabilities
                with business processes to improve automation and workflow.
                I love what I do and I am looking foward to learning more!!!
